# Music Releases
This weeks project was about React - what it is, how to use it and applied it to this project. 

## The problem
The first struggles we stumbled over was getting the data displayed on the browser. Working with the ressources we got from wednesdays lecture got us on the right way but it was the exchaning with a teammember, that brought us there in the end even though we went for a different approach than our teammember in the end. After that we had a rough time with the styling (flexbox), even though we both had quite a good understanding of the flexbox model. Especially getting several artist seperated with "," and "&" in line took quite some time. 

Even though there were several different ways to solve this weeks project we could find answers on stackoverflow and from our teammembers. Also the demo on friday helped us getting faster further with our project.
