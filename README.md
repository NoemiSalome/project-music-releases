# Bootcamp-Project #07: Music Releases
This weeks project was about React - what it is, how it works, its opportunities and how to work with it. This project was realized in a pair programming set up and the design was given.  

## Learning content and lessons learned: 
- API
- dependencies
- introduction to React (Structuring Components, JSX, Props)
- use .map to iterate over array of data and mount many components

This weeks project gave us a bit of a rocky start. There was a lot of new input to wrap our heads around and we both need the big picture first to understand what we are suppose to do and be able to break it into chunks. Exchanging ideas and approaches with teammates helped us in the end to get the project started. After having all the data as requested on browser the next challenge (styling with flexbox) was waiting around the corner. This project was quite challenging but very valuable for the learning process. Once more we realized how valuable our team is. Exchanging ideas and different approaches not only helped with understanding React better, but also speeded up our progress with the project.
